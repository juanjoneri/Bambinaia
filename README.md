## Database systems

### Nannies Website Project
We are attempting to create a first draft for a website that would handle communication between mothers and nannies arround the workd.

So far the website will have the required functionlity for adding new users to the database, both nanny and mother, as well as retreiving the users with a nice 'paper-card' layout of the user's profile.

Database and userbase mantainance, as well as hosting will be handleled using firebase.
